    <h2>Blog Entry 1 - Topic & Research</h2>
    <p>I selected the topic of Autism because I have a family member with Autism and being with that person out in the world has made me aware of just how uninformed people are about Autism and its symptoms.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, I'm on the train and I wish I had a business card or website I could refer them to, so that I could help them to learn about how difficult it can be for people with Autism to act in ways that society considers appropriate. In addition, I would let them know how hurtful it can be to be judged by people's looks and comments.</p>
    <p>In order to research my topic, I looked at blogs, magazine articles, and scientific journals, as well as advocacy pages. I wanted to get a well-rounded understanding of Autism, so that I could see it from a scientific perspective, as well as a social, and political one.</p>
    <h3>Resources</h3>
