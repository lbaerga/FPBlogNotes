    <h2>Freedom Project Blog</h2>
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about using my interests to guide my web design project. As I'm learning, I'm using HTML and CSS and a Web Dev tool of my choice, Animate.css & Wow.js, to make my site more interesting. The project is designed to incorporate hands-on learning</p>

    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p>For my project, I am making a website about Autism using Github, HTML, CSS, and animate.css and wow.js. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Autism and animate.css & wow.js and making the website.</p>

    <h3>Implications</h3>
    <p>The  implications of my website are that people might become more aware of Autism and its signs. 
    This could lead to negative outcomes, for instane, people judging others and thinking that they have Autism, even when they don't. 
    The positive implications might include people becoming more aware of Autism and using that information to tailor their actions so that they are considerate of those with Autism. For instance, designing an event with a cool down room for those with Autism to take a sensory break.</p>
